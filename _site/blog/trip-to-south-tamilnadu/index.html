  <p>This trip was planned such that we will be attending my collegue’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/annamalai.ravi1">Annamalai</a>’s marriage.</p>

<p><strong>Travellers</strong>- <a href="www.balaaagi.me">Myself</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alok.rout">Alok</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gautham.Theertharaj">Gautham</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/karthik.chandrasekaran.9">Karthik</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naveen.selvaraj.94">Naveen</a>
<strong>Mode</strong>- Public Transport and Indica</p>

<p><strong>Trip Day 0:September 3</strong><br />
The marriage was on September 4 near Sivaganga. We started the day before in travels bus from Chennai to Ottanchattiram where which is Naveen’s hometown. We boarded the bus at Perungalathur. But the journey started with some glitches. The bus while coming from Koyambedu got some problems and was stuck near Porur while coming via bi-pass. So the bus came late by around 1.5 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Trip Day 1:September 4</strong><br /></p>

<p>We reached Naveen’s home around 8. The place was at the foothills of Palani hills.The climate was very pleasant. Since muhurtham time was around 12 we started getting ready for marriage in his home. We all planned to wear dhoti for the event. But we did not wear it there since two among us does not have the dhoti and Annamalai has arranged in his place for the same. </p>

<p>We started from Naveen’s place around 9:30 via Indica which Naveen has arranged via his friend in his place. It took around 3 hours to reach the venue of the marriage. But the journey was funny because we need 5+1 driver need to be accomodated in Indica which is a small car. As usual being the lean guy had to keep on rolling my seat over each lap for every half an hour. </p>

<p>On reaching the venue we got ready within half an hour because few of us it was first time we weared dhotis. Alok tried to wear it in North Indian style. He had practised in Chennai itself and it was looking nice for him.</p>

<p>By the time we reached marriage hall(actually home) most of the rituals were over. After wishing  Annamalai we started with our photo sessions for a while. Once most of the guests left for lunch in next street we took group photos with Annamalai and also got some time to talk with him. Actually in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chettiar">Chettiar</a>, marriages  will be held in their family home in villages only. <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g1026932-d497854-Reviews-The_Bangala-Karaikudi_Tamil_Nadu.html#photos">Chettiar Houses</a> will be very grand and they were built long back. It has various levels and properly architected. Lot of woodworks also goes in.</p>

<p>After having lunch we went to another house in next street to watch all the utensils showcase(actually they are given to daughter for her marriage by her parents). Then we changed our costume and headed towards Madurai. We took some rest and started to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meenakshi_Amman_Temple">Meenakshmi Amman Temple</a>. But due to some festival that is being held at the temple we were told we won’t be able to go for darshan. So we proceeded to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirumalai_Nayakkar_Mahal">Thirumalai Nayakar Mahal</a>. We drank the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jil_jil_jigarthanda">jigardhanda</a> from the famous jigarthanda shop. Later we went to room which we have booked near railway station at College House. Karthik started back to Chennai. </p>

<p><strong>Trip Day 1:September 5</strong><br />
After a complete rest we planned to start to temple in early morning. But we started little late but we went to temple and was able to visit all the places inside the temples. By noon we started to Rameshwaram our next destiny. In the middle we delayed for some document work that needs to be done since it was travel vehicle. We thought we will have lunch at Rameshwaram. But seeing the delay we had it before near manamadurai around 3. Almost no shops were there. We went to a small shop and ate parotas and sambhars:P</p>

<p>It was around 4-5 we reached the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamban_Bridge">Pamban bridge</a> which connects the India with the island distict of TamilNadu, Rameshwaram. The climate was awesome we were having our photoshoots for a while and we proceeded. We did not plan anything and we did not book any rooms too. Atlast we found one awesome room for all 6 of us for cheaper rate. After a tiresome day full of travel we slept. </p>

<p><strong>Trip Day 1:September 6</strong><br />
Next day early morning we all got up went ahead to take the holy dip @ Bay of Bengal during sunrise. After having we went for the holy dips on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanathaswamy_Temple">temple tanks</a>. There are around twenty two tirthas(wells) withing the temple with each well tasting differently not salty but. After taking dip we changed our costumes and went for darshan. 
Once the darshan is over we proceeded breakfast. We visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Calimere">Ramarpatham</a> and then we headed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanushkodi">Danushkodi</a> the south eastern tip of Tamil Nadu. </p>

<p>We payed for the haunted island visit cab service. Not sure whether we were lucky or not our cab got breakdown in starting itself. Then we boarded another cab and it took around 2 hours to go around the cyclone hit island. Only few remains were there here and there. The island was very silent.</p>

<p>After finishing the island trip we headed back to Chennai. On the way before reach Pamban we finished our lunch. Then headed directly to Ottanchattiram via Madurai. After having dinner at Naveen’s home we started back to Chennai that night.</p>

<p>It was nice trip with different experience with new set of people.</p>
