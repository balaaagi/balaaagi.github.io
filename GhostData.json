Eventhough my project is following [Classic SDLC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) I am expediting agile methodolgies like [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) , [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) and few more still expediting. <br>\n**Why am I doing this?**<br>\n_Just to make my job interesting by myself and set myself on par with real industry_\n<br>\n\nToday I just learnt one another term which is used in [XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). The term is  **YAGNI**. I got know such a term exist from a quora [question](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/Do-you-respect-the-YAGNI-principle-when-coding/answer/Kiran-Gangadharan?share=1).\n\nMaybe I dunno the term alone but once i read about it I came to know this is very much applying in my daily job of writing code.\n\nYAGNI stands for **You aren't gonna need it!!**. I learnt more about it from the Quora [question](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/Do-you-respect-the-YAGNI-principle-when-coding/answer/Kiran-Gangadharan?share=1) and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it).\n\n**So how this applies to my daily job?**\n\nI develop for a legacy applications which has been live in production for more than seven years. In order to make my job interesting and leverage my Software development skills I try different ways/methodologies to do development.\n\nSo when developing in AGILE we focus on iterations to make users see the product with minimal working functionalities and improve them over the iterations. In that case we will be focussing only on the requirements and we won't be developing additional features or add additional codes which may be useful in future.\n\nBut currently I am unable to do this with my development work since legacy applications run across various countries with same flow. So now when I change a part of code or add a new piece of code to existing part I may have to consider not following the YAGNI principle. Since legacy applications developments usually happens(as far as I know) by tranforming the existing flow of logic from one technology(Initial old technology) to latest new technology. Few of them happens by writing from scratch which just provides the functionalities, whereas most of them follows transforming the logic into different programming language. As result of this adding new features is having great impact on exiting live code.\nFor example lets consider a new feature of developing a interface from legacy system to a financial system. In this case when I develop the new interface feature I have consider writing code for all the scenarios in which the existing legacy system works(eg.countrywise).Even though the interface might/won't be available in future. \nSo writing such codes for legacy applications makes the development process more complex by unit testing a piece of code that won't be used when it goes live as part of this release.This has following impacts directly\n*Delivery time may get delayed. <br>\n*Users may not be able to see the feature on time.<br>\n*Developer's focus on current deliverables shift to a more generalized solution which may not be thought during the analysis/design phase.\n\nFrom management perspective they want the feature to be more generic such that write once deploy anywhere. But for applications where the logic has been merely transformed from legacy code this may not be possible.\n\nI am facing the above issue very much in my development nowadays.....There are two solutions for my problems\n*Either follow AGILE process completely where our focus completely on current release alone so developer need not think about future implementations\n*Rewrite the code completely with more object oriented language such the implementations are so easy with minor tweaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Recently I learnt about one more agile terminology.

It was only during my final year project internet was made available after which I was in responsibility to search job for the survival.\n\nBut moving into corporate washed away all my dreams of becoming techy guy as I wanted to .Many will ask \"What effort did I put to make myself as such?\". Yeah initial one and half years in corporate passed away trying to prove that I can do development works.Where in the hell will I get time to concentrate. Almost spent more than 15 hrs in office to prove them that I can do coding!!Basically I learnt to do coding only!!\n\nAfter that started participating in tech forums,meetups.FB group [Chennai Geeks](http://chennaigeeks.in/home) was my favourite through which I gained, learnt manythings.Then participating in Govt Data Hackathon gave me some more confidence.

But where to start?\n\nHelp came in hand with this [link](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).\n\nThe tutorial has a simple app to store user id and email id in mongo db and retrieve and show to users.\n\nSo instead of using that I made my idea live.\n\nStep 1 was installation which I had done a year back with eagerness to learn node. So basic node with npm is already installed.\n\nStep 2 was to install [express](http://expressjs.com/). I learnt that it is web application framework for single and multi page web applications.\n\n`npm install -g express`\n\nStep 3 Create Basic Express application by simple command.\n`express --sessions mylinks`\n\nStep 4 Adding the dependencies.\n       Whatever I am gonna use it in my application all the related dependencies must be configured here(I have written it under my way of understanding)\nDone in the file that is being created as part of express routine.\n`package.json`\nThis was my initial config in package.json\n<pre><code>{\n  \"name\": \"MyLinks\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"3.4.8\",\n    \"jade\": \"*\",\n    \"mongodb\":\"*\",\n    \"monk\":\"*\"\n  }\n}</code></pre>\nHere [monk](https://github.com/LearnBoost/monk) is used for accessing MongoDB from Node.js.\n\nWith initial learning about Mongo DB queries using [MongoDB University](https://education.mongodb.com) was easily able to insert and retrieve data from MongoDB collections.\n\nHad the difficulty in understanding the how Node.js application works.\n\nThen got a grap of it. Let me put in my works of understanding.\n\nAll the neccesary dependencise will be included using `require`.\nAn object of `express` is mainly used for routing.\nBased on the url with which the object being used the corresponding routes are used and provide the response.\nTo access the database db objects which are created using monk are passed to the routes function. \nFrom the routes function corresponding jade which is the layouts being rendered to the users.\n\nWith intial Setup and code written I was able to select the data from the db and display. But had issues while displaying with JADE. The indentations made it worse.\n\nThen the next feature of adding links to the db.\nCreated a simple form using JADE and on submit called a url which inturn has the neccesary the logic to store in db by getting values from the request.\n\nThen added the feature for having tags to the links.\nWe can store array of mutiple values to a column(field) in MongoDB since it is similar to JSON.\n\nSo stored the tags in the way. Retrieving and displaying again got some trouble with JADE. Used for loop to fetch all the links and for each link had a for loop for all the tags within it. Again indentation problem arised but fixed with option in Sublime to convert spaces to indentations.\n\nNow adding the tags had a problem. How the user will add the tags. We cannot be sure of how many tags can a link be associated with. Hence planned to get user input with comma separated. And fetched the field value and split it using commas and store in array and passed to addlink route.\n`tags=req.body.tags.split(\",\")`\n\nLater want to try another driver used for accessing MongoDB from Node.js.

We again planned for the trip over the first weekend of July 2014.\nOur initial plan was to see all the [Navagraha Temples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navagraha_temples) kinda of little holy trip:P\n\n**Travellers**- [Myself](www.balaaagi.me),[Ko](https://www.facebook.com/komahanpaulraj), [Dinesh](https://www.facebook.com/dinesh.rajee.7) and [Manoj](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1781440509)<br>\n**Mode**-Road by Maruti Swift\n\nAs part of the initial planning I reasearched on the routes for the temples from Kumbakonam. The first search result provided some good map route which seems to cover the whole [Kumbakonam district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbakonam).[This link](http://kumbakonamtemples.in/navagraha-temple-route-maps.html) was what we had as base for our trip.\n\n**Trip Day 1- July 5, 2014**<br>\nI packed myself for the trip took my Mac also along with since had few assignments that need to be completed thought would finish over the travel in car. We started around 6:30 AM as usual we delayed by half an hour leading us to drop in total plan. Our first stop was near [MEPZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Export_Processing_Zone) for breakfast. We had our breakfast in GK hotel which is famous in GST road.\nAfter the breakfast it time to burn the tyres. Dinesh was driving at consistent speed. We had a confusion on whether to reach Kumbakonam via Koliyanur Road or via Pondy--> Chidambaram...\nLater we confirmed that we will proceed with Pondy Route. But near Tindivanam we missed a left which made us to roam for another 1 hr. \nLater we took Mailam road and reached Kallanai.\nIn the meantime our mobile charges went down and the charger connected with the car does not charge the mobile phone.\nSo we were lost. Later we tethered the internet from another mobile used by Mac to find the map route and proceeded. It was around 1:30 by the time when we reached Kumbakonam.\nWe refreshed ourselves at Ko's brother [Palesh](https://www.facebook.com/palesh.paulraj) anna's residence and proceeded with our plan. But now our plan changed due to timings.\n\nSo we headed towards [Tanjore Big Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadeeswarar_Temple) which is around 40kms from Kumbakonam. We reached there before the sunset and we were able to view the temple towers in sunlight. Later we headed towards [Thingalur Moon Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailasanthar_Temple,Thingalur) which was 14 km in North from the Big temple. By the time we reached there it was almost 6-7. Later we moved towards [Swamimalai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaminathaswamy_Temple,_Swamimalai) . It started to rain heavily when we came out after offering our prayers. We halted for a while and started and headed towards Kumbakonam. \nIt was raining heavily in Kumbakonam. Also the streets of Kumbakonam were flooded. Whatever routes we took to reach the residence for sure car would start to float. Water level were so high. We were roaming for all routes like this for an hour. After which we somehow found a street and drove fast to our street. In the street there was no flood it was little elevated compared to other streets. We escaped:P\n\nAfter we reached home all started to sleep since we have to start early next day. But I have not completed my code assignments hence was awake until aroun 1:00 AM and slept afterwards. It was raining till that time.\n\n**Trip Day 2- July 6 ,2014**<br>\nWe still have 8 more temples to see due to the change in plan and we have almost half a day since we have to head towards Chennai by atleast 3:00 PM. So we started early around 6:00 AM.\nWe headed towards [Rahu Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirunageswaram). We finished there and visited the nearby [Uppulipian Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppiliappan_Temple).The temple was closed until 9:00 AM due to some rituals. Hence we came out and had our breakfast to check whether as said by facts \"all food outside the temple will not have salt!!\"\nLater when the temple is opened for darshan we prayed and started from there to [Jupiter Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatsahayesvarar_Temple,_Alangudi). From there we visited the [Sun Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryanar_Kovil) and later the [Venus Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agniswarar_Temple,_Kanjanur).\nIt was almost lunch time. From there we headed towards [Vaiteeswaran Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaitheeswaran_Koil). On our way we had tugs with a local for hitting our car. It took us some time.\nBy the time we reached the temple, they were about to close the premises for lunch time.We quickly prayed and came out before they close the temple.\nThe place was famous for [Nadi Astrology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naadi) and few of them were seeing it after we had our lunch.

We again planned for the trip over the first weekend of July 2014. <br />\nOur initial plan was to see all the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navagraha_temples\">Navagraha Temples</a> kinda of little holy trip:P</p>\n\n<p><strong>Travellers</strong>- <a href=\"www.balaaagi.me\">Myself</a>,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/komahanpaulraj\">Ko</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dinesh.rajee.7\">Dinesh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1781440509\">Manoj</a><br>\n<strong>Mode</strong>-Road by Maruti Swift</p>\n\n<p>As part of the initial planning I reasearched on the routes for the temples from Kumbakonam. The first search result provided some good map route which seems to cover the whole <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbakonam\">Kumbakonam district</a>.<a href=\"http://kumbakonamtemples.in/navagraha-temple-route-maps.html\">This link</a> was what we had as base for our trip.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trip Day 1- July 5, 2014</strong><br>\nI packed myself for the trip took my Mac also along with since had few assignments that need to be completed thought would finish over the travel in car. We started around 6:30 AM as usual we delayed by half an hour leading us to drop in total plan. Our first stop was near <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Export_Processing_Zone\">MEPZ</a> for breakfast. We had our breakfast in GK hotel which is famous in GST road. <br />\nAfter the breakfast it time to burn the tyres. Dinesh was driving at consistent speed. We had a confusion on whether to reach Kumbakonam via Koliyanur Road or via Pondy--> Chidambaram... <br />\nLater we confirmed that we will proceed with Pondy Route. But near Tindivanam we missed a left which made us to roam for another 1 hr. <br />\nLater we took Mailam road and reached Kallanai. <br />\nIn the meantime our mobile charges went down and the charger connected with the car does not charge the mobile phone. <br />\nSo we were lost. Later we tethered the internet from another mobile used by Mac to find the map route and proceeded. It was around 1:30 by the time when we reached Kumbakonam. <br />\nWe refreshed ourselves at Ko's brother <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/palesh.paulraj\">Palesh</a> anna's residence and proceeded with our plan. But now our plan changed due to timings.</p>\n\n<p>So we headed towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadeeswarar_Temple\">Tanjore Big Temple</a> which is around 40kms from Kumbakonam. We reached there before the sunset and we were able to view the temple towers in sunlight. Later we headed towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailasanthar_Temple,Thingalur\">Thingalur Moon Temple</a> which was 14 km in North from the Big temple. By the time we reached there it was almost 6-7. Later we moved towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaminathaswamy_Temple,_Swamimalai\">Swamimalai</a> . It started to rain heavily when we came out after offering our prayers. We halted for a while and started and headed towards Kumbakonam. <br />\nIt was raining heavily in Kumbakonam. Also the streets of Kumbakonam were flooded. Whatever routes we took to reach the residence for sure car would start to float. Water level were so high. We were roaming for all routes like this for an hour. After which we somehow found a street and drove fast to our street. In the street there was no flood it was little elevated compared to other streets. We escaped:P</p>\n\n<p>After we reached home all started to sleep since we have to start early next day. But I have not completed my code assignments hence was awake until aroun 1:00 AM and slept afterwards. It was raining till that time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trip Day 2- July 6 ,2014</strong><br>\nWe still have 8 more temples to see due to the change in plan and we have almost half a day since we have to head towards Chennai by atleast 3:00 PM. So we started early around 6:00 AM. <br />\nWe headed towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirunageswaram\">Rahu Temple</a>. We finished there and visited the nearby <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppiliappan_Temple\">Uppulipian Temple</a>.The temple was closed until 9:00 AM due to some rituals. Hence we came out and had our breakfast to check whether as said by facts \"all food outside the temple will not have salt!!\" <br />\nLater when the temple is opened for darshan we prayed and started from there to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatsahayesvarar_Temple,_Alangudi\">Jupiter Temple</a>. From there we visited the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryanar_Kovil\">Sun Temple</a> and later the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agniswarar_Temple,_Kanjanur\">Venus Temple</a>. <br />\nIt was almost lunch time. From there we headed towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaitheeswaran_Koil\">Vaiteeswaran Temple</a>. On our way we had tugs with a local for hitting our car. It took us some time. <br />\nBy the time we reached the temple, they were about to close the premises for lunch time.We quickly prayed and came out before they close the temple. <br />\nThe place was famous for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naadi\">Nadi Astrology</a> and few of them were seeing it after we had our lunch. It was around 2 when we started back to Kumbakonam and within few minutes we started back to Chennai. <br />\nThis time we came via Koliyanur route which was pretty simple and clear. Throughout our journey towards Chennai we were being accompanied by heavy rain.</p>\n\n<p>Atlast it was very holy trip but missed three temples according to our plan....</p>\n\n<p>Another weekend spent seeking the blessing of lords:)</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1407073624835,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1407081733144,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1404973800000,"published_by":1}],"users":[{"id":1,"uuid":"2c95038b-d003-4468-b20e-0d2606cf058a","name":"Balaji
