Currently working with a company whose main focus is `"Better Food For More People"`. Exploring Rails, GoLang and also fiddling with Java.<br>
I worked for a FinTech Startup - [CreditMantri](https://www.creditmantri.com/) where I was responsible for rearchitecting the complete platform in a cleaner way to accomodate the scale.More about this in this [post](http://blog.balaaagi.in/2019/03/15/creditmantridays/) <br>
