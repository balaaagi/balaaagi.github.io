I'm Balaji Srinivasan , an engineer  based out of Bengaluru, India. 


I used to work for an Indian Unicorn [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/) as part of the logistics engineering team as Lead engineer. Played around Rails, GoLang and also fiddling with Java. <br>
Prior to this I worked for a FinTech Startup - [CreditMantri](https://www.creditmantri.com/) where I was responsible for rearchitecting the complete platform in a cleaner way to accomodate the scale.More about this in this [post](http://blog.balaaagi.in/2019/03/15/creditmantridays/) <br>
Prior to CreditMantri I used to work for [Ford Motor Company](https://www.india.ford.com/) developing enterprise applications in [Java](https://java.com/en/) and mobile apps in [Android](https://www.android.com/)
