For summer I wanted to take a core courses also I wished to take something in AI field.
Was in dialemma to take between knowledged Based AI vs AI for robotics. Both seems to involve some coding as well learn some new concepts in AI field.
Later choosed KBAI CS7637.

Am pretty much excited about the course and wanted to be so planned and dedicated this summer and ensure that I learn well.

Summer classes has begun I am just going through the Piazza forum on the course.
