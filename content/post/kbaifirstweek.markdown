The class has started first week went with just the introductions and below tasks
* Introduce yourself in Piazza
* Go through the assignments
* Complete the Pre Course Survey

The pre course survey contained a set of questions that made the course team to mingle us with people of our interests and location.
It also had questions about the programming language proficiencies etc..

Once done I have started going through the lectures of the course starting week 1.

##Learnings

In first set of lectures we were introduced the basics of AI like
 * Conundrums of AI
 *  Basic characteristics of AI problems
 * 4 schools of AI
 * What is an AI agent and its characteristics?
 * What is deliberations[reason, learning, memory]
 * General architecture of a cognitive systems
 * Relation between AI and cognition
 * What are [Raven's problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) and how are they used for testing human intelligence

 With these much introduction we dived into core topic that we will be using for representation of AI problem.
 [Semantic Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network) is a way in which we represent the problem in AI using nodes, actions and relationships. It is a way in which we can solve Raven problems.
We tried to solve 2x2 problems using semantic network and learnt the relation how our brain works using relationships.
