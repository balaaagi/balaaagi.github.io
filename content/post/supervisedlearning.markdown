In the lecture series so far in the Supervised Learning we have learnt the various topics as below

## Neural Networks
## Ensemble Learning - Boosting
## SVMS or Kernal Methods
## Computation Learning Theory
## VC Dimensions
## Bayesian Learning
## Bayesian Inference


Almost ready for the midterm. But need to learn various proofs or examples from the Textbook to getter better understanding.
