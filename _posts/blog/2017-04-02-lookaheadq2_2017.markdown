*****

These are the plans for my Q2 of 2017. Since I was able to achieve only 25% of the plan in Q1 moving few to this quarter and more focussed.
I would say this quarter is more focused on becoming an expert in Android

### Health
* Eat food on time and regularly avoid junk foods
* Run/Walk daily 3-4 kms

### Personal Life
* Spend more time with family
* Learn car driving and ensure to get license

### Self Improvement
* Make reading a regular habbit.Ensure to read atleast 5 books under various categories before end of March, 2017
* Make writing a regular habit. Ensure to write devlogs and learning logs atleast regularly.Atleast write more about the android learning in android logs
* Publish as many Android apps in Play Store to get a decent profile in the play store and become an expert in Android.
