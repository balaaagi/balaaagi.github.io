While I was designing my long pending personal website I have added [GithHub](www.github.com) profile link. But what could I find in Github were just two repositories.
*Initial GitHub Practicing repository
*Govt Data Hackathon repository.

Even though I have done few personal projects and developed few applications I am unable showcase it.

Reason for it most of the applications I did were done in my company as part of the internal contest.The ideas that I developed or prototyped might not be applicable for public or available for social coding where other can have a sneak peak on it and provide their valuable feedback for me to improve myself.

Due to this I hosted these projects in [BitBucket](www.bitbucket.com) in private repositories.

Hopefully once I have started developing apps or my personal projects I will completely host in GitHub itself for my benefits atleast.
