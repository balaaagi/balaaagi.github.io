This year have taken a resolution to read lot of books in various generes. I love technology and always love coding and being called as a developer. I started reading a book [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7003902-97-things-every-programmer-should-know) by Kevlin Henney.

It's collection of wisdom thoughts that we should always remember in life as long as we are programming. Below are my short notes about the various thoughts discussed in the book.
