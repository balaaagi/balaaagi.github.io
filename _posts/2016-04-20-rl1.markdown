### Introduction

* The whole activity of having a models function with rewards and identifying the policy is called as planning.

* Reinforcement Learning is learning in which the learner takes in transitions with source,desitination,action and rewards and identify the optimal policy in which we get the maximum reward.


### Approaches to Reinforcement Learning

* States to action- Policy Search algorithm trying to find policy --> Direct Use but indirect Learning
* Utility to State - Value function based approaches are used for observe the values for each state and actions.
* Transition Function/Model - Predicts next states or rewards - Model Based --> Indirect Use but direct learning
