In order to get my knowledge more on Machine Learning started learning [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

[Edx](https://www.edx.org/) gave an XSeries provided by databricks. There are totally three courses altogether
* Introduction to Apache Spark
* Distributed Machine Learning With Apache Spark
* Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark

Due to the budget constraints I am not going to register for the verified track. Since need to save some money for my OMSCS courses.

In coming days I will writing about my learnings in the course via the blog.

Hoping to complete all the three courses in two/three months duration.
