After trying to learn android by making some apps during hackathon or during hobbies wanted to become an expert in it. I wanted Android and ML to be my core expert area in the software development.

And to my luck Udacity introduced the scholarship in association with [Tata Trusts and Google](https://www.udacity.com/india). Applied and got selected.

The program invite was dispatched on November 18. 

Completed the [first project](https://github.com/balaaagi/BalajiAppPortfolio) to kick off it.

Will be recording my learning in the android in this category blogs.

Below are my targets to become proficient in Android and launch the apps in playstore before May, 2016 in addition to the apps as part of the NanoDegree.
