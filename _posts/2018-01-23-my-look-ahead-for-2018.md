Inspired by others in developer community where people keep yearly goals and work towards them wanted to have something personal to me and keep track of my progress. I have shared this with my friends/mentor whom I feel will give proper feedback to improve myself. The categories of rating below helps my mentor to rate me frequently where I stand.

Have a made a public [trello board](https://trello.com/b/f5f9gR3N/better-me-2018) where they can track my progress.

Looking forward for a great year ahead..
