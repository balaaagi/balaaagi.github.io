In this lecture series professor explains with instance based learning
It is nothing but learning based on instances of data
*Lazy Learning- Learn at last after creating a model - Knn Neighbour
*Easy Learning - Learn as soon as we receive the data

###knn
* Started with storing things in DB and querying but what will happen when no such combinations are present
* Find the nearest closest value/similarity(distance)
* Use distance formula to calculate the nearest distances
	* Euclidian
	* Manhattan
	are two such formulas for calculation of distances.
* If there are more nearby values then calculate the averages
* Curse of Dimensionality- More data more dimensions
* Locally Weighted Regression
