After a gap of term due to severe back pain back to the classes. Have taken the same class that I have dropped in Fall 2015. Yeah it's Machine Learning.

Am writing this before taking the first lectures for this term to ensure I am determined this time and more focussed towards the field of Machine Learning.


Taking Few Resolutions this term in order to equip myself for a great roller coaster ride ahead.

* Focus on the concepts and learn the basics well
* Ensure to watch lectures for atleast 2-3 on all the weekdays
* Read the study material/extra learning material wherever required.
* Try to implement all the programming excercise in Python

Hopefully will be able to complete the course with great learnings.

Wish me Goood Luck!
