The first project that came all along it's way in Android a area of mobile space where I want to get deep expertise.
The project is to make a mathematical calculator in Android.
The main objective of this project was to get familiar with the environment and Android platform.
As I have done few projects already in mobile application development it was little easy for me to get accustomed with the environment. I mainly wanted to design the application in a more Object Oriented way. Hence made sure that I developed in the following way

*	Followed TDD for core functionalities
* 	Implement main core functionalites as separate classes
*	Just use the objects of those classes in Android activities.

I was able to complete the project on time and learned quite a few stuffs as below

*	Separate core functionalities from the Activities
*	[Alert Dialogs](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlertDialog.html) how to display alert dialogs
