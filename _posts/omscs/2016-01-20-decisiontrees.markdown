Decision tree is one of the learning algorithm for classification or regression problems

Basically its a set of `if then... else...` rules for identifying a solution.

* Lecture start by giving various attributes or examples for going to a restaurant

* Then it deeply explains on the concept using the golf playing on saturday decision

* Best algorithm is [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) for decision tree

* Other concepts like Entropy, Information gain are used to identify the best root node based on which the decision tree is build

* Cross validation can be done using testing the algorithm against the training data set using various combination of the models.

* When few cases does not have any proper data either the average of other similar data or same data as others are considered in order to identify the node
