In first set of lectures we were introduced the basics of AI like

 With these much introduction we dived into core topic that we will be using for representation of AI problem.
 [Semantic Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network) is a way in which we represent the problem in AI using nodes, actions and relationships. It is a way in which we can solve Raven problems.
We tried to solve 2x2 problems using semantic network and learnt the relation how our brain works using relationships.
