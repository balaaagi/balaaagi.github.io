Since I have applied the earlier they were able to evaluate my application in a very lesuirely way and update me on the status very soon. Yes!!

I received my application decision on October 7, 2014. The mail stated "Application decision is available".

Was very confident this time at the same time was very tensed when I was clicking the link. 
Literally I was shiverring in my chair. 

On clicling applyweb portal URL I need to open the Decision available PDF to check my decision. 

Until I find some positive words like 'happy','glad','congratulations' I din read the full decision letter.

Yeah those words were there. Immediately read the full letter and confirmed that I was successfully admitted to the program. 

I was reading those decision letter multiple times that day. Was very glad and happy. Dunno who to say my happiness. Wanted to thank lot of people for this.

* I actually wanted to convey this to my parents but they were sleeping so keeping this happy news for them next day
* Immediately whatsapped my sissys [Jayasree](https://www.facebook.com/annapoorani.srinivasan.79) and [Aparna](https://www.facebook.com/karpagam.srinivasan.37)
* Next messaged my friends who helped me to go through the phase of failure from last admit rejection and encouraged me to apply again
[Madhava Jayamani](https://www.facebook.com/madhava6688) and [Sukanya](https://www.facebook.com/sukanya.kalaichelvan)
* Whatsapped my well wisher and my mentor in Office [Rajesh](https://www.facebook.com/desikan.rajesh)

Then I slept very happily. Next morning conveyed the happy news to parents they were also very happy. After that I left to office.
When reaching office only I realized that the message to Madhava was not delivered. Actually October 8 is his birthday. I called to wish him but din wish him first instead started with this news and was very thankful for him for his help for the application also wished him for becoming old more...

As people started coming to office first approached their desk and just showed the decision letter to them. Indeed was very happy that day.This is what I did 
* [Benita](https://www.facebook.com/benita.gabriella)- English mummy who corrected my grammer and [Sukanya](https://www.facebook.com/sukanya.kalaichelvan)
* [Santio](https://www.facebook.com/santio.ruban)- English sir who helped in making my huge huge huge huge essay to the required size
