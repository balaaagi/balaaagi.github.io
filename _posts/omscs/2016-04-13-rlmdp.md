###Introduction

* In Supervised learning we are given `x` and `y` and we should find the `f(x)`using function approximation techniques.
* In Unsupervised learning we are give `x` and we should using clustering methods to find the `f(x)`

####Reinforcement Learning

  In reinforcement learning we are given `x` and `z` we should find `y` and `f(x)`
