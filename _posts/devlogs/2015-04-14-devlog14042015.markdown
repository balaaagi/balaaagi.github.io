It is [Tamil New Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puthandu). So today office is off which is actually a optional holiday.

* Was working on to complete [cricinfo curler](https://github.com/balaaagi/CricInfoCurler). Removed few features which I thought would be great but actually was irrelavant.
* Registered for the [Mimino](https://github.com/Mimino666) 24 hours coding. Let's see I am able to learn some great things from the expert during the [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/469361889882977).
* Registered for [Save the Hacker](http://www.savethehacker.com/) with two ideas. Hoping to get selected for main event.Need to start warming up though
